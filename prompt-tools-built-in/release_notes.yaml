      description: |
          Write a direct instruction as if the user is telling you what they want in the release notes. This should be phrased as a user command or request in first-person, such as:
          - "Please organize the release notes with Features, Bug Fixes, and Performance Improvements sections"
          - "Include emoji icons next to each feature item in the release notes"
          - "Make sure to highlight the security fixes prominently in this changelog"

          The instruction should be specific and representative of how a user would naturally phrase their requirements for release notes documentation.
