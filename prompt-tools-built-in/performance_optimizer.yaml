    # What
    This tool provides comprehensive performance optimization guidance by:
    - Analyzing performance bottlenecks and hotspots
    - Recommending optimization strategies
    - Evaluating rendering and computation efficiency
    - Optimizing database queries and data access
    - Improving algorithm complexity
    - Suggesting caching and memoization strategies

    # Why
    Use this tool when application performance needs improvement. It's particularly valuable when:
    - User mentions performance issues, slowness, or bottlenecks
    - User shares performance profiling results
    - User needs to prioritize optimization efforts
    - Discussion involves rendering, database, or algorithm efficiency

    This tool helps improve application performance by identifying bottlenecks and providing targeted optimization strategies.
