    # What
    This tool provides comprehensive API documentation guidance, including:
    - API endpoint specifications and descriptions
    - Request/response format documentation
    - Parameter validation and requirements
    - Authentication and authorization details
    - Error handling and status codes
    - Rate limiting and usage guidelines
    - Environment-specific configurations
    - Request/response examples

    # Why
    Use this tool when conversations involve API documentation. It's particularly valuable when:
    - User asks for help writing API documentation
    - User shares incomplete API details
    - Discussion involves documenting endpoints or interfaces
    - Critical documentation elements are missing, such as:
      * Base URL or environment information
      * HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
      * Content types (JSON, XML, form-data)
      * Request/response examples
      * Required/optional parameters
      * Response status codes and error handling
      * Authentication requirements
      * Rate limiting information

    This tool helps create clear, complete, and consistent API documentation that follows industry best practices.

          Write instructions as if the user is telling you what additional information to include in the API documentation. Focus on commonly missing elements. The message should sound like a user providing requirements, not like you asking questions.

          Examples:
          - "Please make sure to include request examples for both valid and invalid inputs"
          - "For each parameter, specify whether it's required or optional and include default values"
          - "Document all possible response status codes and their meanings"
